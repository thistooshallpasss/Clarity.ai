# Clarity.ai: AI Super-Resolution Web App âœ¨

[![Hugging Face Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/BlackJack84/ai-image-upscaler)

A complete end-to-end web application that uses a Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) to upscale low-resolution images by 4x. This project demonstrates the entire lifecycle of a deep learning application, from training in PyTorch to deployment via a Flask API.

## ðŸš€ About The Project

The goal of this project was to build and understand a complete end-to-end deep learning pipeline. The core of the application is an SRGAN model trained on the high-quality DIV2K dataset. The trained model is served through a Python Flask backend and is accessible via a simple, user-friendly frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Built With
* **Backend:** Python, Flask
* **ML/DL:** PyTorch
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Dataset:** DIV2K

---

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

The application is powered by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with two main components:
* **Generator:** A deep neural network with 16 residual blocks that takes a low-resolution image and intelligently adds realistic details to upscale it.
* **Discriminator:** A convolutional neural network trained to distinguish between real high-resolution images and the AI-generated ones.

The training process uses a combination of three loss functions to achieve photorealistic results:
1.  **Content Loss (VGG19 Perceptual Loss):** Ensures that the upscaled image has similar features to the original high-resolution image.
2.  **Adversarial Loss:** Pushes the Generator to create images that are indistinguishable from real photos.
3.  **Pixel Loss (L1 Loss):** Minimizes the pixel-wise difference between the generated and real images.

---

## ðŸ“Š Results and Analysis

The model was trained for **25 epochs** on the DIV2K training dataset using a Google Colab T4 GPU. The performance was evaluated on the unseen DIV2K validation set.

### Quantitative Results
* **Average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR): 9.88 dB**
* **Average Structural Similarity Index (SSIM): 0.4263**

### Analysis
These initial scores indicate that the model has successfully learned the fundamental task of upscaling and adding detail. The fluctuating discriminator loss during training showed a healthy adversarial dynamic.

However, the scores are at a baseline level. The primary reason for this is the **limited training duration (25 epochs)**. State-of-the-art SRGAN models are typically trained for hundreds of thousands of iterations, which would significantly improve these metrics. This project serves as a strong proof of concept and a baseline for further training.

### Visual Results
Here is a sample comparison from the validation set after 25 epochs:

## ðŸ§  Challenges and Learnings

* **Hardware Limitations:** Training GANs is computationally expensive. This project highlighted the difference in training time and capability between a free-tier GPU and production-level hardware.
* **Large File Management:** The trained model file exceeded GitHub's 100MB limit. This was solved by implementing **Git LFS (Large File Storage)**, which is a standard practice for handling large model artifacts.
* **GAN Dynamics:** Observed the classic "cat-and-mouse" game between the Generator and Discriminator through the fluctuating loss values, providing practical insight into GAN training.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Improvements

* **Extended Training:** Train the model for over 100,000 iterations to significantly improve PSNR/SSIM scores and visual quality.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different learning rates, loss function weights, and optimizer settings.
* **Advanced Architecture:** Implement more advanced models like ESRGAN for potentially better results.
* **Deployment:** Deploy the final application to a cloud service like **Hugging Face Spaces** or **Google Cloud Run** for public access.
